Many of the graves within the cemetery are not actual descendants of the Billings family, and instead extended family or friends of the family.

The Headstones of the Billings family were stored inside due to weather damage and vandalism. These stones share many similarites with other stones of the same religious affiliation under the British graveyard scheme.
